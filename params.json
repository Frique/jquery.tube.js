The basic approach is centered around 'tube' objects: a\r\ntube is an abstract container filled with videos based on a YouTube\r\nplaylist, user's feed or a search query; a tube offers the basic control and\r\nevent handling interfaces you would expect from a playlist (play, pause, next,\r\netc.) and is associated with a player instance. A player is a thin wrapper\r\naround YouTube's iFrame or (if window.pushMessage is unavailable) JavaScript\r\nplayer API; thus, the player is intended to work transparently on legacy\r\nbrowsers (IE7) and HTML5 capable devices without Flash support.\r\n\r\nThis plugin contains no stylesheets; tube instances create simple HTML\r\nlists of their contents (the structure can be adjusted for each instance\r\nthrough a simple template system).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nSimply grab `jquery.tube.js` or `jquery.tube.min.js` from the project's\r\nroot directory. For [bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) users simply\r\nrun:\r\n\r\n    $ bower install jquery.tube\r\n\r\nOr add \"jquery.tube\" as a dependency to your `component.json` file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nIf all you want to do is play a video, you can create a new player instance\r\nwith a YouTube video ID:\r\n\r\n    $('#player-container').player({ video: 'ylLzyHk54Z0' });\r\n\r\nYou can pass more options to set up event handlers or specific YouTube configuration\r\noptions; you can retrieve the player object using jQuery's data method, like this:\r\n\r\n    $('#player-container').data('player');\r\n\r\nMore interesting than the player object, however, are tube objects. A tube is\r\nbasically a bunch of videos based on either a user's feed, a specific playlist,\r\nor a search query on YouTube. For example:\r\n\r\n    $('#playlist-container-1').tube({\r\n      player: 'player-container',\r\n      query: 'lolcats',\r\n      limit: 5\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThis will display five cat videos (just what the world needs) in the\r\n'playlist-container-1'; if you click on any of the videos the video will\r\nstart playing in a new player instance created in 'player-container'.\r\n\r\nNext, you could add a second playlist whose videos will play back in\r\nthe same player instance:\r\n\r\n    $('#playlist-container-2').tube({\r\n      player: 'player-container',\r\n      user: 'GoogleDevelopers',\r\n      limit: 5\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThis will add the latest five videos uploaded by the user GoogleDevelopers.\r\n\r\nFor more examples, consult the examples in the `demo` and `test`\r\ndirectories.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nThis plugin uses the awesome [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha)\r\nframework for testing; in order to run the tests you need to install a\r\nfew libraries through npm:\r\n\r\n    $ npm install\r\n    $ npm test\r\n\r\nIf you customize any of Tube's components, you can build a new version of\r\nthe plugin as follows:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle install\r\n    $ rake build minify\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Sylvester Keil, Thomas Egger.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
