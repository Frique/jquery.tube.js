        <h3>Play YouTube Videos with jQuery</h3>

<p>jquery.tube.js is a jQuery plugin to access YouTube's <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">player</a>
and <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/reference">data</a> APIs
transparently. The basic approach is centered around 'tube' objects: a
tube is an abstract container filled with videos based on a YouTube
playlist, user's feed or a search query; a tube offers the basic control and
event handling interfaces you would expect from a playlist (play, pause, next,
etc.) and is associated with a player instance. A player is a thin wrapper
around YouTube's iFrame or (if window.pushMessage is unavailable) JavaScript
player API; thus, the player is intended to work transparently on legacy
browsers (IE7) and HTML5 capable devices without Flash support.</p>

<p>This plugin contains no stylesheets; tube instances create simple HTML
lists of their contents (the structure can be adjusted for each instance
through a simple template system).</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>If all you want to do is play a video, you can create a new player instance
with a YouTube video ID:</p>

<pre><code>$('#player-container').player({ video: 'ylLzyHk54Z0' });
</code></pre>

<p>You can pass more options to set up event handlers or specific YouTube configuration
options; you can retrieve the player object using jQuery's data method, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#player-container').data('player');
</code></pre>

<p>More interesting than the player object, however, are tube objects. A tube is
basically a bunch of videos based on either a user's feed, a specific playlist,
or a search query on YouTube. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$('#playlist-container-1').tube({
  player: 'player-container',
  query: 'lolcats',
  limit: 5
});
</code></pre>

<p>This will display five cat videos (just what the world needs) in the
'playlist-container-1'; if you click on any of the videos the video will
start playing in a new player instance created in 'player-container'.</p>

<p>Next, you could add a second playlist whose videos will play back in
the same player instance:</p>

<pre><code>$('#playlist-container-2').tube({
  player: 'player-container',
  user: 'GoogleDevelopers',
  limit: 5
});
</code></pre>

<p>This will add the latest five videos uploaded by the user GoogleDevelopers.</p>

<p>For more examples, consult the examples in the <code>demo</code> and <code>test</code>
directories.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>This plugin uses the awesome <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha">mocha</a>
framework for testing; in order to run the tests you need to install a
few libraries through npm:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install -g mocha
$ npm install -g should
$ npm install jsdom
$ npm install jquery
$ rake test
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a Rakefile that makes it easy to build and minify the plugin:</p>

<pre><code>$ rake build minify
</code></pre>
